#   Program to calculate the Simple Interest
#
#   The formula for Simple Interest is
#   si = p * r * t
#   where si is the simple interest
#   p is principal
#   r is interest rate
#   t is number of years

p = 18819.99    # principal
r = 0.05           # rate of interest
t = 2              # years

si = p * r * t
print("Simple interest at the end of 2 years $", si)
